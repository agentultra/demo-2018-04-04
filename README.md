# demo-2018-04-04 #

I decided to try something new and implement the game,
[sprouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game)).

I was a little tired tonight and slightly out of my element dealing
with mouse events and experimenting with more of the path/stroke API
in canvas.

I didn't get as far as I thought I might but it's a start.

- Time to first interaction: 15 mins
- Time to get hover working: 10 mins
- Time to get lines drawing: 25 mins
- Time to get state persistence for lines: 15 mins

## Controls ##

You only need your mouse.

Refresh to get different (random) placement of the initial circles.

Hover over a circle, click-and-drag to start drawing a line.

If you mouse-up over an empty space the line will be erased.

If you mouse-up over a circle the line will stay.
